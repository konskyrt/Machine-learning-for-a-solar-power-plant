# Solar-panel-efficiency

# This is my final project during my 3 month bootcamp studies at Propulsion Academy Zurich.
# We correctly identified several reasons that drop panel efficiency, either due to Physical phenomena and Technical aspects of the solar panels.
# The model can identify the trend of panel efficiency over time and detect the impact of soiling on solar panels.
