# Solar-panel-efficiency

This is the final project during my 3 month bootcamp studies at Propulsion Academy Zurich.
We correctly identified several reasons that drop panel efficiency, either due to Physical phenomena and Technical aspects of the solar panels.
The model can identify the trend of panel efficiency over time and detect the impact of soiling on solar panels.
